# Stats

Display some basic statistics with an associated icon. If included in a section with an inverted background using `.bg-inverted` it will make the icons white as well.

## Stats icons

Note that these icons are not included as part of the standard set. You will need to include your own svg sprite for icons that are not part of the standard set (see icons component)
